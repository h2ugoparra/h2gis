# H2MARE - Geospatial Processing for Climate and Ocean Data

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.11%20%7C%203.12%20%7C%203.13-blue)
[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/h2mare)](https://pypi.org/project/h2mare/)

A Python pipeline for downloading and preprocessing multi-source oceanographic and atmospheric data into analysis-ready formats. H2MARE streamlines the acquisition and harmonization of data from major climate and ocean observation services, optimized for large-scale spatiotemporal analysis.

## Features

- **Multi-source data integration**: Download and process data from CMEMS, AVISO, and ERA5.
- **Format conversion**: Automated conversion from NetCDF/GRIB to optimized Zarr and Parquet formats.
- **Data compilation**: Regrid and interpolate multi-resolution datasets to a common grid.
- **Point and geometry extraction**: Extract time series for specific locations or spatial features.

## Data Sources

H2MARE supports the following data providers. API keys and authentication are required for each.

- **[CMEMS](https://marine.copernicus.eu/)** — Copernicus Marine Service: satellite and in-situ ocean observations
- **[AVISO](https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/home.html)** — Archiving, Validation and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic data
- **[CDS-ERA5](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/)** — ERA5 hourly atmospheric reanalysis (1940–present)

Refer to each provider's documentation for authentication setup before use.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.11
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — fast Python package and project manager

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install h2mare
# or
uv add h2mare
```

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/h2ugoparra/h2mare.git
cd h2mare
uv sync
```

## Configuration

H2MARE requires two configuration files in your working directory before first use.

### 1. `config.yaml`

Defines variables, dataset IDs, bounding boxes, and processing parameters. Copy the [template from the repository](https://github.com/h2ugoparra/h2mare/blob/main/config.yaml) as a starting point and edit it to match your needs.

### 2. `.env`

```env
# Path to external or large-capacity storage for processed Zarr files
STORE_ROOT=/path/to/your/storage

# AVISO credentials (required for FSLE, Eddies)
AVISO_USERNAME=your_username
AVISO_PASSWORD=your_password
AVISO_FTP_SERVER=ftp-access.aviso.altimetry.fr
```

CMEMS credentials are configured via the `copernicusmarine` client. ERA5 / CDS credentials are configured via the `cdsapi` client. See the [CDS documentation](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/how-to-api) for setup.

> **Note:** Both files must be present in the directory where you run `h2mare`. You can also set the `H2MARE_ROOT` environment variable to point to a different directory containing them.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Download and process a single variable for a specific date range
uv run h2mare run -v sst --start-date 2021-01-01 --end-date 2021-12-31

# Multiple variables at once
uv run h2mare run -v seapodym -v mld -v o2 -v chl

# Infer missing dates from the existing store and download what's new
uv run h2mare run -v sst

# Download only (skip Zarr conversion)
uv run h2mare run -v sst --no-convert

# Validate configuration without downloading
uv run h2mare run -v sst --dry-run

# Process all configured variables
uv run h2mare run
```

## Development

```bash
# Run the full test suite
uv run pytest tests/

# Run a single test file
uv run pytest tests/test_zarr_catalog.py -v

# Lint and format
uv run ruff check h2mare/
uv run ruff format h2mare/
```
